// Output Assignment

/* Brainstorm an original idea for some variables you can create and values you can
   assign that tell me something about you.  Your code should include the following:
   Comments
   An example of a string variable
   An example of a number variable
   An example of a Boolean variable
   Output for each variable
*/

// This is an example of a string variable
var myCatName = "Little Miss Kitty Cakes";
// Here is the output for the string
console.log(myCatName);

// This is an example of a number variable
var myCatAge = 1;
// Here is the output for the number
console.log(myCatAge);

// This is an example of a Boolean variable
var isCatFemale = true;
// Here is the output for the Boolean
console.log(isCatFemale);

// Here is an extra console output combining all the variables
console.log("I have a cat and her name is \'" + myCatName + "\'.");
console.log("She is only " + myCatAge + " year old.");
console.log("It is " + isCatFemale + " she is a female.");
